        <p><b>Continuous abstinence :</b></p>
        <p>This means not having sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) at any time. It is the only sure way to prevent pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV.</p>
       
<h3 style="color:#000080;">Barrier Method:</h3>
<p><b>Female condom:</b></p>
<p>This condom is worn by the woman inside her vagina. It keeps sperm from getting into her body. It is made of thin, flexible, manmade rubber and is packaged with a lubricant. It can be inserted up to 8 hours before having sex. One should use a new condom each time they have intercourse. One should not use both female and a male condom at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Male condom</b></p>
<p> Male condoms are a thin sheath placed over an erect penis to keep sperm from entering a woman's body. Condoms can be made of latex, polyurethane, or "natural/lambskin". The natural kind do not protect against STIs. Condoms work best when used with a vaginal spermicide, which kills the sperm. And one need to use a new condom with each sex act.

<p><b>Condoms are either:</b></p>
 <ul>
  <li>Lubricated, which can make sexual intercourse more comfortable</li>

Oil-based lubricants like massage oils, baby oil, lotions, or petroleum jelly will weaken the condom, causing it to tear or break.</li>
  <p>Department of Family Welfare has been procuring condoms with effect from 1994-95. Under the free distribution scheme, condoms under brand name 'Nirodh' are made available to acceptors free of charge through Primary Health Centers and subcenters in rural areas and through hospitals, dispensaries, MCH centers and post-mortem </p>

While taking extended cycle pills, women only have their period three to four times a year. Many types of oral contraceptives are available in the market like I pill etc.

In addition, the scheme of oral pills was launched in 1987 with the brand name Mala D by government of India.</p>

<p> The lack of maternal health contributes to the economic disparities of mothers and their children.

Poor maternal health not only affects a child’s health in adverse ways but also decreases a woman’s ability to participate in economic activities. Therefore, national health programs such as the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the Family Welfare Program have been created to address the maternal health care needs of women across India. Although India has witnessed dramatic growth over the last two decades, maternal mortality still remains high as in comparison to many developing nations.

India contributes to nearly 20 percent of all maternal deaths worldwide between 1992 and 2006. The primary reasons for the high levels of maternal mortality are directly related to disparities of economic conditions and cultural constraints limiting access to care.

However, maternal mortality is not identical across all of India or even a particular state urban areas often have lower overall maternal mortality due to the availability of adequate medical resources. For those states where there is higher literacy and growth rates tend to have greater maternal health and also lower infant mortality.</p>

<ul><li>Depression</li>

</ul>

<p> The suicide rate is particularly high among female sex workers in India, who face numerous forms of discrimination for their gender and line of work.</p>
<p><b>Domestic Violence:</b></p>
<p> Domestic violence is a major issues in India. Domestic violence is defined as acts of physical, psychological, and sexual violence against women is found across the world and is currently viewed as a hidden epidemic by the World Health Organization.

However, the actual number of victims may be much higher. The study found that the poorest women faired worst among middle and high-income women.</p>
