        <h3 style="color:#000080;">Introduction:</h3>
        <p>Alcohol use is widely prevalent in Indian society and consequently results in widespread losses in the form of injurious physical health outcomes like cirrhosis of liver, heart disease, diabetes as well as leads to absenteeism, road traffic accidents and various mental health and behavioural problems.
Alcohol is one of the leading causes of death and disability globally and the same is true for our country India. A total of 3.2% of deaths worldwide are caused by alcohol every year.  As per World Health Organization One fourth to One third of male population drinks alcohol in India and neighbouring south Asian countries and the use amongst women in increasing.
Alcohol Use Disorder is the continuous use of alcohol despite evidence of harm and repeated attempts to cut down the use.
It includes tolerance to alcohol which means higher amount is needed progressively to have the same effect and a characteristic cluster of mental and behavioural symptoms appearing when one does not take alcohol i.e., withdrawal.
Alcohol use disorder results in harm and damage to one’s physical and mental health, affects one’s functioning at work and results in relational conflicts and social and legal problems.</p>

        <p>Alcohol use is quite common in India both in rural and urban areas with prevalence rates as per various studies varying from 23% to 74% in males in general  and although it’s not that common in females but it has been found to be prevalent  at the rate 24% to 48 % in females in certain sections and communities.
In 2005 the estimated numbers of people using alcohol in India was 62.5 million with 17.4 % of them (10.6  million) having alcohol use disorder and of all hospital admissions in India 20-30% are due to alcohol related problems.</p>
<h3 style="color:#000080;">Remember: Alcohol drinking can be a mental health disorder:</h3>
<p>Please remember that if you or anybody around you is struggling with the inability to contain the alcohol use and consequently facing a lot of problems on all fronts because of alcohol use consider taking him for treatment as it is a mental health disorder which can be treated by proper treatment and compliance</p>
<h3 style="color:#000080;">Road Traffic accidents:</h3>
<p>In India as per a government  report almost 1,34,000 people died in road accidents in 2010, a staggering figure of 336 persons dying daily and a study by alcohol and drug information centre(AIDC)  India has  revealed that 40%  of road traffic accidents occur under the influence of alcohol. Majority of such persons are young and are in the productive age group of 20-50 years, making drunken driving a menace for our country.</p>
<h3 style="color:#000080;">Crime and alcohol:</h3>
<p>Various studies worldwide have reported a strong association between alcohol use and indulgence in high risk behaviour, domestic violence, high risk sexual behaviour, crime and violent acts</p>
<h3 style="color:#000080;">Suicide:</h3>
<p>Almost 10-15% of people with alcohol related problems commit suicide which is markedly high as compared to general population and hence significant number of lives can be saved if it can be managed early and appropriately.</p>
<h3 style="color:#000080;">Drinking makes you fall asleep is a myth:</h3>
<p>Usually people take alcohol thinking it as a good sleeping aid, but here it should be noted that although alcohol can make it a bit easier to fall asleep it actually disturbs the sleep architecture resulting in decrease in deep sleep and fragmented sleep and ultimately frequent and longer periods of awakening. So refrain from using alcohol as a sleeping pill.</p>
