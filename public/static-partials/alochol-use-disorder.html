<h3 style="color:#000080;">Crime and alcohol:</h3>
<p>Various studies worldwide have reported a strong association between alcohol use and indulgence in high risk behaviour, domestic violence, high risk sexual behaviour, crime and violent acts</p>

<h3 style="color:#000080;">Drinking makes you fall asleep is a myth:</h3>
<p>Usually people take alcohol thinking it as a good sleeping aid, but here it should be noted that although alcohol can make it a bit easier to fall asleep it actually disturbs the sleep architecture resulting in decrease in deep sleep and fragmented sleep and ultimately frequent and longer periods of awakening. So refrain from using alcohol as a sleeping pill.</p>
