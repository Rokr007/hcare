        <h3 style="color:#008080;">How to take care of your elderly parents?</h3>
        <h3 style="color:#000080;">Aging is a natural process. Sir James Sterling Ross commented: You do not heal old age. You protect it, you promote it and you extend it.</h3>
        <p> One day, our parents may not be able to drive, to climb stairs, or maybe not even change their own clothes or feed themselves. Our parents could one day be fine and then suddenly the next day need a great amount of care, so the more prepared  we are in advance, the less stressful this might be for our whole family. No one wants to think about their parents at the end of their days, much less talk about itEven so many of us never discuss with our parents about things like living arrangements in retirement, long-term care, inheritance, and funeral wishes. 

As painful as thinking about this might be, we need to prepare to help them be comfortable and safe in their last stages of their lives. Here are the things to consider.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#000080;">Health check up, Screening and Immunization: </h3>
         <ul>
  <li> Periodical health check up for management of chronic diseases and screening for early detection of disease includes</li>
  <li>Care of the problems due to ageing process as senile cataract, glaucoma, nerve deafness, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis affecting mobility, failure of special senses, and change in mental outlook.</li>
  <li>Care of the problems associated with long term illness-certain chronic diseases are more frequent among the older people such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, accidents, disease of locomotors system, respiratory illnesses as chronic bronchitis, asthma, emphysema, diseases of genitourinary system.</li>
  <li> Care for psychological problems</li>
</ul> 
       
<h3 style="color:#000080;">Recommended Immunisations:</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Immunisation recommendations are based on age, health status, location, risk factors and other factors therefore talk to healthcare professional to see which vaccine is needed</li>
  <li>Flu vaccine every year</li>
  <li>Vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough and a tetanus booster if it has been more than 10 years since their last vaccine. </li>
  <li>If your parents are 60 or older, get a vaccine to prevent shingles. Even if they had shingles, you can still get the shingles vaccine to help prevent future occurrences of the disease.</li>
  <li>If your parents are 65 or older, get a pneumonia vaccine (also known as a pneumococcal vaccine). </li>
</ul> 
<h3 style="color:#000080;">General health related problems in Old age:</h3>
 <ol>
  <li><h3 style="color:#000080;">Balance Disorders:</h3></li>
  <p>So many times you find out that your parents may not able to walk properly not able to listen what are you saying or they may feel unsteady or dizzy, as if they are moving, spinning, or floating, even though you are standing still or lying down. Balance disorders can be caused by certain health conditions, medications, or a problem in the inner ear or the brain.</p>
  <li><h3 style="color:#000080;">Problem with taste</h3></li>
  <p> Taste disorders can weaken or remove an early warning system that most of us take for granted. Taste helps us to detect spoiled food or liquids and for some people, the presence of ingredients to which they are allergic

Many of us take our sense of taste for granted, but a taste disorder can have a negative effect on our   health and quality of life. If your parents are having a problem with their sense of taste they need a doctor as soon as possible.</p>
  <li><h3 style="color:#000080;">Sleep and ageing </h3></li>
  <p>Sleep pattern changes according to our age. Children and adolescents need more sleep than adults. Interestingly, older adults  need about the same amount of sleep as younger adults -- seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Unfortunately, many older adults often get less sleep than they need. One reason is that they often have more trouble falling asleep. A study of adults over 65 found that 13 percent of men and 36 percent of women take more than 30 minutes to fall asleep. This disorder is known as Insomnia.There are some more sleeping disorders like snoring problem, sleep apnea, movement disorder.</p>
  <li><h3 style="color:#000080;">Healthy meal plan for old Aged peoples:</h3></li>
  <p>What to eat?</p>
  <p> To stay healthy and fit, it is good if we choose a mix of nutrient-dense foods every day for our parents. Nutrient-dense foods are foods that have a lot of nutrients but relatively few calories. Look for foods that contain vitamins, minerals, complex carbohydrates, lean protein, and healthy fats.
Plan their meals and snacks to include:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Fruits and vegetables</li>
  <li>Grains, especially whole grains</li>
  <li>Low-fat or fat-free dairy products</li>
  <li>Seafood, lean poultry and meats, beans, eggs, and unsalted nuts</li>
</ul> 
<h3 style="color:#000080;">Vegetables:</h3>
<p>Eat a variety of colours and types of vegetables every day</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Broccoli, spinach, turnip and collard greens, and other dark leafy greens are good choices.</li>
  <li>hey might also choose red and orange vegetables, such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, red peppers, or winter squash.</li>
</ul> 
<h3 style="color:#000080;">Fruits:</h3>
<p>They may eat a variety of fruits every day according to their health status. To make sure they get the benefit of the natural fibre in fruits, choose whole or cut-up fruits more often than fruit juice.</p>

<h3 style="color:#000080;">Dairy Products:</h3>
<p> Low-fat or fat-free dairy products you should add in their diet on daily basis. These products provide calcium and vitamin D to help maintain strong bones. They also provide protein and potassium. Low-fat or fat-free milk, cheese and yogurt are good options.

If they don't drink milk, be sure to have other products that contain the nutrients that milk provides. Some cereals and juices are fortified with extra calcium and vitamin D. Salmon, sardines and mackerel are good sources of vitamin D.</p>
